# Image mosaics from feature matching

This is our proposed solution for the lab ["Image mosaics from feature matching"][repo] in the computer vision course [TEK5030] at the University of Oslo.

Please see the [lab guide] for more information.

## Prerequisites
- OpenCV must be installed on your system. If you are on a lab computer, you are all set.

  If you are on Ubuntu, but not on a lab computer, we refer to [setup_scripts](https://github.com/tek5030/setup_scripts) and [the intro lab] as a general getting started-guide for the C++ labs on Ubuntu 22.04.

  You will need to compile OpenCV from source to enable the `xfeatures`-module.
